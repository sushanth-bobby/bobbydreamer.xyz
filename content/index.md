# Hello, i am Sushanth.

Welcome to my site.

I am a mainframe Db2 DBA. Yep, mainframe is still there and as usual its highly scalable, highly available and highly secured.

If you don't know what mainframe is, you should see this, this is how our work environment looks like.

This site is my sandbox, probably will contain collection of my unorganized programming notes, things i learned doing some home projects, fav. music, self development, notes taken while watching youtube videos, etc., more or less.

Thanks
