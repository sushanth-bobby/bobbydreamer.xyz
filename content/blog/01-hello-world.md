My first post in V3 of my website [bobbydreamer.com](http://www.bobbydreamer.com) using gatsby

Basically i take lots of notes and only a few get into my organized notes section and theres lots of papers here and there hanging around and if i don't find time to organize these things then it means the entire time i had spent in reading/listening is a waste of time. So, if i ever come to a situation, that i need to refer it again then it will be like, i will have to start from beginning like beginner beginning. I will remember but to get the doubts off, i have to go through it like this. **My process**. 

To make things worse my organized notes section is not soo organized as well, its another mess. In time, i have lots of books/papers with notes and my moms like *'can i throw this away, i don't see you looking at it and its soo dusty'* and i got to a mindset, if i dont refer it in say last two year period, it can be thrown away, i dont need/want to recheck it as i don't remember it, so i don't need it(not a brilliant move but keeps old stuff off the room).

Working in IT, there is too much to learn and too much to remember, needed a way to dump things and **this** makes it easy to refer and organize.

To whosoever reading this, except me

If some posts in this website, seem confusing, under-explained, out-dated.. its probably, not written for you! Sorry :D . One can think making notes public, its not a brilliant move, well, there's not much traffic happening in my site as i am not that famous or anywhere near to it. I have an average 15-32 unique users per month guessing half of that user is me, checking my site in incognito-mode to see if its up and working as expected and remaining could be scrape bots doing some analytics and i think there could be one or two users, actual human people(those poor souls). 

There are couple of things, i am experimenting by doing all this,     

1. This is way better than saving URLs in [stash](https://www.stash.bobbydreamer.com). Why ? After using my app for over two years, when i try to refer to URLs which i had saved 6 months back, its not working. 

    * That site is upgraded and entire URL path is changed 
    * That user stopped paying for hosting, so domains gone.
    * Moved to different domain 
    * Deleted the post

    All the scenarios listed above are practical. So, cant blame anybody. Lesson learnt is saving URLs to referback thing is not working. So falling back to old method of taking notes. 
    Con : Its a time consuming process. Need to have discipline.

    * By putting all the notes in a blog like order, i sort of keep the notes, organized. Thats a good thing instead of saving it in a folder somewhere. 

2. Also, by doing all this, i am also trying to learn writing. I don't write that much, if i write anything that will be mostly in bullet points and precise. I am in a situation like 'Paragraphs' What are those ? I have heard about it. 

##### What this site will have

*Nothing related to work*. Mostly my test, notes, what i have learnt, how i use them, step-by-steps, how to's, errors & solutions sort of like guide for me.hmmm. 

Alrighty then!
