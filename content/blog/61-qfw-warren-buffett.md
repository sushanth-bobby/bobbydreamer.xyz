##### Buffett on Salomon issue

* "If you risked something that's important to you, for something unimportant to you that's just doesn't make sense" and people with top IQ made this blunder

##### Intellect should be the servant of the heart but not it's slave

This is a quote by *'Auguste Comte'*. An author analyzes Buffett's thought process. 

Buffett acknowledges that other textile businesses in the U.S. had been closing at a fast clip in the years leading to his decision, and then admits: Their owners were not privy to any information that was unknown to me; they simply processed it more objectively. I ignored Comte's advice - "the intellect should be the servant of the heart, but not its slave" -- and believed what I preferred to believe.

The more I've thought about them, the more I realize they succinctly summarize one of the key reasons why so many people get on the wrong life path, or pursue the wrong career, or simply make bad strategic decisions.

They're the literal opposite of the well-meaning but dead wrong advice that so many give: in short, "follow your passion."

However, it does seem that Buffett's "intellect" was "the slave of his heart" for 20 years, because he permitted other emotions and passions to prevent him from seeing the truth. These passions included some things that people might find laudable -- for example, a desire to keep the failing textile businesses going as long as possible, because they employed so many older workers who didn't have transferrable skills. But, they also included others, like the emotional reaction that led Buffett to buy Berkshire Hathaway to begin with, which had to do with a perceived slight from the company's former CEO (and Buffett's desire to control Berkshire in order to fire him).

> Piece of Information to be desirable, it has to satisfy two criteria 
> 1. It has to be important

Macros are extremely important but it's not knowable. Since it's not knowable, trying to base your approach on macro is waste of time.
