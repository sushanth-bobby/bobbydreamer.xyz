**Created on:** 2020-03-19    

I always liked designers and architects, very creative people. In web technology, man there are a lot of creative people with fantastic ideas and designs. For me, it sort of became a practise, whenever i see a new things like designs, css effects, color palette, way of ordering elements, UI designs, responsiveness, i take a screenshots, save the links and some times inspect the element how they did this, sometimes i even go to the extent of searching for it in youtube and watch the live coding and hear comments to learn their coding style. I have truly become a fan of lot of people subscribed to their newsletters/channels and read their articles whenever its out.  

So when i decided to make a new version of my website, i am basically going to go though all the things i have collected overtime. From the look of it, i got to know, its going to be a lengthy and tedious process as i have collected too many things and got to know some of the links are not working anymore and sites have been upgraded, so sometimes, the reason why saved up that link is not there anymore. Feel like an idiot sometimes, as i should have taken a screenshot instead of saving up the link.

Here are some things i have collected between 2018 - 2020. Its just unorganized collection of things. For this, i used [stash.bobbydreamer.com](https://stash.bobbydreamer.com), a small note taking app i had built using javascript & firebase, this seriously served its purpose. 

##### Body background
Amazing designs and images which responds to clicks would be great for a page background.

##### Sidebars
If you are planning on having a websites with lot of categories like some documentation site, sidebars would be great.

> Note : Sidebar is for a personal webiste as it consumes space.

Fonts are essential part of a website as that will be the content. It shouldn't be hard to read. Below are some sites, i have come across, where i liked the fonts.

##### Menus 

My site should have below menus, 
* **AboutME** - It should say bit about me and it can act like a resume as well. A page cannot wasted describing about me, it should be about my works
* **Articles** ( Tags ) - This will contain Technical articles, Notes on videos i have seen and other things. 
* **Songs** - I should put up a list of all the songs i like and if anybody visits, they can click like or dislike the song. Thinking, this could evolve into a separate app of playlists which people can share. Not a list of 1000s of songs but let just say 30. 
* **Videos** - Yeah. Youtube has this way of removing content, but when the content is removed, it just says "Deleted content" something like that, it doesn't say what got delete. So, i am going to list my fav. videos here. 
* **Pictures** - I have a weird way of taking snapshots in VLC player of movie scenes. I have no idea why ? So i thinking of making a picture gallery. 
* **Contact** - Think whether this should come separately or can add it in "About me". 
* **Fan** - After visiting lots of sites, reading, learning, listening & watching videos. I have become fan of lots of people and their beautiful idea, vision, knowledge and depth of things they know. They are my Subject Matter Experts of that field. Thing is, i cant be remembering all the people and their works to which i have become a fan. I need a place to store this knowledge, so when i need'em, i know where to find. This page will be dedicated to those people.
