Stoicism teaches the development of self-control and fortitude as a means of overcoming destructive emotions; the philosophy holds that becoming a clear and unbiased thinker allows one to understand the universal reason. Stoicism's primary aspect involves improving the individual's ethical and moral well-being: *"Virtue consists in a will that is in agreement with Nature."* This principle also applies to the realm of interpersonal relationships; "to be free from anger, envy, and jealousy", and to accept even slaves as "equals of other men, because all men alike are products of nature".

#### Some Stoic Lessons

Inner scorecard is important not the outer. Hunger to get better. 

Be glad what's happening or happen to you. As only you can deal with it and handle it. Better me than somebody else. 

Journal is for yourself. It should be first thing in the morning and every evening you should review that  day. In the Journal, write quotes
Ask yourself self tough questions in every page
Action you take, choice you make
Why am i here ? How should I live my life ? Is the path where I am going is that what I want ? 
Ask every moment is this necessary ? Is it essential ? 
Find something that makes you better everyday. Assemble your life action by action everyday. 

Set your expectations straight     
  When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they can't tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are unnatural.
Review and prepare for the things you will be facing in a day, you have to be prepared for that. Healthy mind should be prepared for anything. You should be like a wrestler, waiting, poised and dug in for sudden attacks.  

You should prepare plan and meditate on how you aim to act each day. Envision everything, prepare your best response to them. 

We do not learn from experience, we learn from reflecting on experience. -- Dewey

Let it go. Don't take revenge. It just makes you get to their level. 

Do rather than tell
Say less than necessary, think before you speak. 

Public fame can turn into public shame, they are not under our control. We   should pursue Only things within our control like inner quality, contentment, joy, restraint, right action, tranquility

If you want to be beautiful, you have to make beautiful choices

Design your life like a routine

All negatives should happen in the mind, so that we can be prepared for them, when it happens. By anticipating for things we take power from them. What unacceptable is 'i did not think that could happen'. 

Time that has passed belonged to death. This moment is important. 

Remember you have power to have no opinion

Don't suffer imagined troubles. Focus on what you have to do now. 

Be tolerant with others and strict with yourself

Seek out challenges, exercise, push yourself. 

In every situation, there are two handles. Grab the one that improves or grows or challenges you. 

Say no. If it's not essential, don't do it. This gives you time to say yes to what matters.  

Asking for help isn't giving up. It's refusing to give up. 

What's bad for the hive is bad for the bee

Don't judge other people, leave them to their own struggle. 

Life can be depressing and sad and dark, look for beauty in ordinary things, you will have something to smile. 

Associate with people who make you better. 

We don't control what other people do, we can control only how we respond. 

You possess nothing in this life. All our loved ones are ours only in trust.  Our loved ones are ours as long as we have them and then they go away. 

Accept success without arrogance and handle failure with indifference. Don't let circumstances change you. Be humble. 

Obstacle is the way. 

Stillness is the key. Slow down and see things clearly. Step back, zoom out a little. Focus

Invest time in creating new memories

Practice endurance sports
