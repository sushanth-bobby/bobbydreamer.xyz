Quotes from Sir John Templeton
> "PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS ASKING ME where the outlook is good, but that's the wrong question. The right question is: "'Where is the outlook most miserable?" 

> "lf you want to have a better performance than the crowd, you must do things differently from the crowd." 

> "Bull markets are born on pessimism, grow on skepticism, mature on optimism and die on euphoria. The time of maximum pessimism is the best time to buy and the time of maximum optimism is the best time to sell." 

> "MAJOR CAUSE OF HIGHER PRICES is higher prices; but when the trend is reversed, then lower prices lead to still lower prices. To buy when others are despondently selling and to sell when others are avidly buying requires the greatest fortitude and pays the greatest ultimate rewards." 

**Trouble is opportunity**     

**Tech Bubble** : Insiders of the tech companies knew the companies were overvalued. Thing is there is this IPO lockup they cannot sell.
