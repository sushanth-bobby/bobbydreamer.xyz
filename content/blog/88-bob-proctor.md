I was told to write what I want in a card, I wrote $25k, that's a lot of money even if i sum up all the money my friends had, it wouldn't add up to $25k. Till that time I was thinking about debt I had and after that I was thinking about $25k. We become what we think about. That goal card changed my mindset. 

When I choose a person as a mentor, I will do exactly as they tell until I find they are lying or they don't know what they are talking about.

John Kennedy asked Dr.Wernher von Braun What does it take to build a rocket. He said "a will to do it". 

Ignorance starts as doubt and worry at consciousness level and the image what forms we pass it to the emotional mind that becomes fear and that fear is expressed through the body as anxiety and anxiety is not expressed it is suppressed and that suppression becomes depression. This is a very negative track. 

Wealthy people have more than one source of income

If you set a goal and you know how to do it, it will go side ways. You have to set a goal that you don't know how to do it. Then there is a steep learning curve and you need to have mentors who can guide you.
