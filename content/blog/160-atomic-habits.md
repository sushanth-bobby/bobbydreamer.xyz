* Systems > Goals > Habits

* Changing outcomes(results like losing weight,  writing book)

* Changing processes( what you do,  workout routine,  daily reading habit)

* Changing identity(what you believe, world views and how you think of others)

* Goal isn't to learn a instrument,  but to become a musician. 

* Goal isn't to run a marathon,  but to become a runner

* Look for cues that initiates good or bad habit loops

* Making it obvious

* Make a habit score card. Write down what you do all day, put + or - then how much time it took. 

* Stack habits - After brushing your teeth,  you will do Push up

* Making it attractive

* Craving is what makes up take it. 

- Thinking of eating junk food increases dopamine than after eating it. Same with drug users

* Habit tracker - Have a checkoff list in calender,  in diary. Visual tracker is better.

* Habit contract - you miss a day you pay for it.   This makes you accountable.
