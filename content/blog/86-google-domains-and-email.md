This is something i didn't know at first and later got to know it. How late ? 3 years late. 

Once you setup a site with **Google Domains**, you get upto 100 custom email addresses which you can use to forward emails to existing email address. Meaning, i have created a website **[www.bobbydreamer.com](https://www.bobbydreamer.com)** using Google Domains and it provides a feature using which i can/have created a personalized email like **sushanth@bobbydreamer.com** and when somebody sends an email to this address, i get that email forwarded to **bobby.dreamer@gmail.com** likewise i can setup around 100 custom alias email addresses. 

For a business this could be really useful. 

##### Setting it up is really easy. 
1. Get a domain with Google domains. 
2. Click on the Email link on the left 
3. On the right bottom you will see link **Add email alias**
