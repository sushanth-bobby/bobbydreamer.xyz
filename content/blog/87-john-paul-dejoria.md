* Invest in your business before you invest into other people's business as I have lost lot of money in investing in other people's business. Why ? You have control over your business and you know what will come out of it. 

* From statistics 90% of people will lose their lottery money in the first 5years. So be very conservative, think like this is the last money you will ever make, do you want out in that investment or That person or somewhere safer or your business. 

* Dont be around negative people, stay away from them. You want their friendship but keep them far away. 

* In the end, everything will be okay... If it's not okay... It's not the end. 

* Forgive and let it go. You don't want to carry that burden on your shoulders.
