##### Capitalism Works

* Capital seeks the highest returns possible: High profits attract competition.
* So....most businesses with high returns on capital will see returns decrease over time.

##### Moat Basics

* Economic moats are structural & sustainable qualities that are inherent to the business.
  - Not hot products. (Heelys? Krispy Kreme?Sugar is a moat)
  - Not just a cool piece of tech (lomega?In tech there will be a newer with more advanced product)
  - Not the biggest market share (GM? Compaq?)

* Moats generally manifest themselves in pricing power: A company that can't raise prices is unlikely to have a strong moat.

**INFO**: We looked at companies that maintained Return on Capital above Cost of Capital for 15+ years.    
* What are the common characteristics of these business
* Whats the similarities in these business

##### Intangible Assets

* Brands
  + Increase willingness to pay / lower search costs
    - Sony(Tech product:who buys VCD Players) vs. Tiffany(Diamonds, its worth it)
    - Amazon, Groupe Richemont, Coca Cola İçecek

* Patents

* Legal monopoly vs. expiry/challenge/piracy 
  + If one drug is driving all the economic value, if that patent is getting challenged, you are dead. So, you have to be very careful. 
  + Novo Nordisk, Qualcomm, Chr. Hansen

* Licenses/ Approvals
  + Legal oligopoly vs. regulatory fiat 
  + Casinos(limited licenses), landfills(nobody likes to live there, less number licenses), aircraft parts(Most of the parts are made by one company, good business)

##### Widening the Moat: Brands

* Brands are valuable if they deliver a consistent or aspirational experience. 
  + Consistency lowers search costs & drives loyalty. Don't change & give people a reason to switch!
    - Mistake: New Coke, The Schlitz  

* Aspiration increases willingness to pay. So, create scarcity & exclusivity.
  +Tiffany's store layout(40% revenue comes from stuff that costs less than $200 and shop layout is like costly items in front and cheap at last)
  +"You don't own a Patek Philippe, you merely take care of it for the next generation."

>Confidence is how other people see you.

##### Switching Costs
* Does the cost of switching to a competing product or service outweigh the benefits?
  + Integrate with customer's business: Upfront costs of implementation payback from renewals
    - Silverlake Axis, Oracle, SimCorp 
    - Migrating to Oracle to another database is a expensive thing for a multi-national company, they will not go for it. So, lock-in is a good thing.
 
  + Sell ongoing service relationships
    - Rolls Royce, Otis, Kone, Schindler
    - Kone is a elevator company, once a elevator is setup, its not coming out. Rolls Royce, sells JetEngine they change you by the hour. You pay is related to how much you use it. 

  + Provide a product with a high benefit/cost ratio 
    - Fastenal(Makes bolts, product doesn't cost much, but brings huge economic cost to the company), Ecolab, Novozymes, Fuchs Petrolub
    - Lubricant which improves performance of a mining machine, that lubricant costs less when compared to the actual machine or production, so even if they increase 20%, they will pay for it.

##### The Network Effect

* Provide a service that increases in value as the number of users expands.
  + Aggregate demand b/t fragmented parties.
    - Edenred, Henry Schein(used by dentists), XPO Logistics

  + Non-linearity of nodes vs. connections. 
    - Visa, Mastercard, Facebook

* Western Union is Radial, they have lots of branches but nobody is sending money from Bangladesh to Chicago or Mexico

##### Cost Advantages

* Process: Invent a cheaper way to deliver a product that can't be replicated quickly.
  + Inditex, RyanAir, GEICO, Dell

* Scale: Spread fixed costs over a large base. Relative size matters more than absolute size. 
  + UPS, Aggreko, Stericycle

* Niche: Establish minimum efficient scale

##### What About Management?
* "Good jockeys will do well on good horses, but not on broken-down nags." (Buffett)

##### Moats, Management & Mistakes

* Moats can buffer management mistakes 
  + Microsoft minted money despite Steve Ballmer
  + New Coke didn't kill Coca-Cola
  + Moodys put profits before integrity, and still cranked out a 40% operating margin
  + But even a genius like David Neeleman couldn't change that fact that JetBlue is an airline - the worst industry known to mankind.

##### The Good & the Bad
* Good managers are constantly looking for ways to widen a company's moat
  + Amazon's focus on the customer experience(There is a lots of trust involved)
  + Costco's focus on using scale to lower costs

* Bad managers invest capital outside a company's moat, lowering overall ROIC
  + This process is called "deworsification," or "setting fire to large piles of cash."
  + Example Cisco -- Starting a consumer business, Garmin -- Starting a GPS Handset business(Every phone has GPS)

##### An Exception to Every Rule

* A tiny minority of managers can create enormous value via astute capital allocation - even if they don't start with great horses.
  + Warren Buffett (Berkshire), Brian Joffe (Bidvest), Dick Kovacevich (Wells Fargo), Steve & Mitch Rales (Danaher)

* They are hard to find, and false positives abound...but they can create enormous wealth over time. Keep an eye out!

##### Valuing Moats
* The value of an economic moat is largely dependent on reinvestment opportunities

* The ability to reinveset tons of cash at a high incremenetal ROIC = a very valuable moat.
  + Fastenal, XPO, Curro

* If a firm has limited ability to reinvest, the moat adds little to intrinsic value.
  +McCormick, Microsoft, Oracle

##### Isn't Moat Already Priced In ?
* Moats usually matter in the long run than in short
* Most investors assume the current state of the world persists longer than it usually does.

##### Finding Moats = Finding Inefficiency
* Quantitative data is efficiently priced in
* Qualitative insight is less efficiently priced

##### Moats in a Global Context
* Local differences create moats 
  + Canadian banks, Edenred, German car washes

* Minimum efficient scale is more common South African retailers, Globo, BEC World

* Cultural preferences create barriers to entry Beer travels. Candy & snacks generally don't.
