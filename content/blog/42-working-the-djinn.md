> **Djinn**     
> an intelligent spirit of lower rank than the angels, able to appear in human and animal forms and to possess humans. 

Mind is completely a different animal, it talks to us and sometimes we talk back to it. Its capable of giving ideas and suggestions, sometimes they are great and other times they could be lame. Here, i am calling the mind as DJinn, it needs to be equipped with right motivation, attitude and mindset to handle all the things that come at it and i have to make it my best ally. 

All the below notes are taken while reading books, hearing audio books and youtube videos. Some of which motivate and inspire me. 

The first quote that really motivates me is my [school motto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_Church_Anglo-Indian_Higher_Secondary_School). **Do your best**. At first at school, i didn't understand it, but i used to read it everyday at school assembly as its in the wall and in my school badge. Thing is, now after a very long time after school, it started to pop in my head, whenever i work or start something new like a project, i remember it. I sort of have come to a stage, i cannot do anything less than best, i put my full and all my effort in the work i do. 

> Do your best

Those three little words.

In this instance, of you are looking for signals and significants in every situation, you start creating things that arent real. You will get stimulus from everywhere. 

*Everything has significance but not everything is significant.* We got to watch that fine line where do we intuit, where do we fell the truth. 

If we are hunting for significants in every single thing, the sub-plots become unmanageable

* If you practice playing piano, 8hrs a day, 40hrs a week, 50weeks a year for 40yrs, I know you will be a accomplished pianist or if you practiced anything. 

* Think independently, follow good ideas and action and stay with it.

* There are only two things for financial success,

  - The work we do for living. This has the key to success. There is always an opportunity in the work you do if you look for it. How many ideas do you get in a day. One of those ideas can make you rich. How do you think your job will be handled 10yrs from now. Can you do it that way now. You must know everything you do about your job and application to your industry. If you focus you can become a expert in a field in 5 years. You are working only for yourself. Each day you Are building the house you and your must live in, materials and construction you put into your house determines its strength and your degree of greatness. 

  - Amount of money we save Systematically till we become independent that's how it can be accumulated and put to work. One should save more than 10% every year.

##### Said by Jocko Willink

* Take ownership of everything happening in your life.
* Discipline equal freedom
* Be balanced

Play the damn game to build relationship and win strategically. If your boss gives you paper work do it better than anybody and submit it before due date. If you cannot do a simple work how can you a big work. You are building relationship because later when you push back he(boss) will listen. If you take playing the game too far, you are kissing ass and your team will loose respect of you. If the push back is proper and bosses idea doesn't make sense, you tell your idea and see if he agrees and go back and tell your team and see how to make it work(your idea or bosses idea) 

To be more acceptable form of society and civilization is made up of people of varying beliefs. To be prosperous you must learn to love and let live. And give privileges we ask and demand for ourselves. This can be achieved by strict discipline on ourselves.

* Anything can be fixed, fix it, pay the price, become the most dependable person in your space, become the goto person, be the goto person. 
* Bring commitment, disicipline and persistence to your game 
* You will be underpaid most of your life, once day if lucky, you will be over paid. 
* At the end of the day in sales, if a guy talks to 10 people and another guy talks to 200 people, the guy who talked to 200 people is going to win the game. If the one skill you got to learn is, how to move through 200 calls/people without causing you stress. If you see ball players they don't get upset because they lost a game. They are in it for the long run. Develop ability to withstand rejection
* If you struggling/slumping go help somebody, don't work on your thing.  Go into charity mode. Work free for somebody. This is where you can try something which you wouldn't try on your work or deals. All this helps you loosening you up because when you are struggling it tightens you up. 
* I don't want to do stupid shit on money I worked hard for. I want to do stupid shit on money i didn't work hard for(passive income).

##### Said by John Maxwell

* Act like the person, you want to become
* I am not perfect, I am Work in progress 
* Little extra effort is all it takes to be extraordinary 
* We over estimate what can happen in a day, we underestimate what can happen in several days

* * *
#### How it should be

* Focus on the present, whats before you, what  you need to do(chores). Activities and tasks. 
* Dwelling on the past, doesn't help. Any thought about past, it should be about, how it should have been done, like a lesson learnt and how it should be carried out going forward. If its not above don't dwell thinking about it. 
* If you done a mistake, go ask *sorry* genuinely, don't keep thinking about it. 

##### Mindfulness
* Listen
* Say **Thank you** (Gratitude)
* Intentionally focus on people and things that made you feel good. 
* How you feel internally and externally(experiences)
  + Meditation - Simply focus on your breathe for 15mins
  + Know, you are what you eat, you are what you think

##### Deep work, Cal Newport
Two Core Abilities

1. Quickly Master Hard Things
2. Produce at an Elite Level, in Both Speed and Quality

**Deep work**     

Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.

Shallow work (opposite of deep work)
Non Cognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate."

The Rules For Deep Work

* Rule #1: Work Deeply
* Rule #2: Embrace Boredom
* Rule #3: Quit Social Media
* Rule #4: Drain The Shallows

To become a A High-Skilled Worker, A Superstar or An Owner. You need to Schedule Your Day, Drain the Shallows, Quit Social Media , Become Hard to Reach

> Discipline yourself to focus on what you know is good for you. You have a list of habits already that you probably follow â€” like exercise, reading, leisure time, meditation â€” and you can focus your time there and get far better returns than the endless porn-fuelled addictions of meaningless nonsense. -Tim Denning

Remember Theodore Roosevelt's famous â€˜The Man in the Arena' talk wherein he said â€“Â 
> It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.
