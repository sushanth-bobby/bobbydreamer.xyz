Inspired by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/uses/) `/uses` page. Here are the techs i use @Home on day-to-day basis, 

#### Laptop
* **Sony VAIO** : Model VPCF1390X, Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU, Q740@1.73GHz, Internal Storage 150GB, Memory 6GB
* **OS** : Windows 10 Home
* **Additional Storage** : 1TB WD Passport, 1TB iOmega
* **Purchased on** : 21/Feb/2011

#### Editor
* **Visual Studio Code** : Its my primary editor for Web development and Python at the moment.
* **Sublime** : When VS Code gets slow or when it takes too much memory, i switch to Sublime. This is one of the lowest memory consuming editor. For all SQLs & CLI works, i use this.
* **Notepad++** : For small edits i use this

I keep multiple tabs open all the time, so i really like all the above editors as it saves state. 

#### Database
* **MySQL** : Test databases 

#### Softwares
* Eclipse for Java Development 

#### Desktop Apps
* **OneNote** : I have my Todos here 
* **Browser** : Primarily Chrome and when it slows down, i switch to Opera

#### Chrome Extensions (First 3 are must have for me)
* The Great Suspender
* Momentum 
* OneTab
* Fair Adblocker
* JSONView

#### Headsets 
* Microsoft Lumia Headset
* Boult Red Audio Neckband Q9

#### Music 
* Spotify

#### CLI Tools
* Git
* Gatsby Cli
* Gcloud

Also 1 Small table fan on the side just to cool the laptop.
