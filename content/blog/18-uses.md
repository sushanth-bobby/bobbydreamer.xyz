Initially bought below UPS without even thinking of the CPU Power Supply(850Watts) and below UPS is 360W. UPS turned off as soon as power went off.  So had to order the above one. 

Currently using this UPS for Laptop and Router

Didn't go for inverter option due to space issue and electrical setup.

## Laptop (From 2011 to 2024)

> [!attention]
> Got to a stage where Windows Antimalware takes more CPU than other processes. Adding to that Windows 11 Automatic upgrades were too big and system started becoming slower and Windows EOL warning started to come

* **Sony VAIO** : Model VPCF1390X, Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU, Q740@1.73GHz, Internal Storage 150GB, Memory 6GB
* **OS** : Windows 10 Home
* **Additional Storage** : 1TB WD Passport, 1TB iOmega
* **Purchased on** : 21/Feb/2011

### Editor
* **Visual Studio Code** : Its my primary editor for Web development and Python at the moment.
* **Sublime** : When VS Code gets slow or when it takes too much memory, i switch to Sublime. This is one of the lowest memory consuming editor. For all SQLs & CLI works, i use this.
* **Notepad++** : For small edits i use this

I keep multiple tabs open all the time, so i really like all the above editors as it saves state. 

### Database
* **MySQL** : Test databases 

### Softwares
* Eclipse for Java Development 

### Desktop Apps
* **OneNote** : I have my Todos here 
* **Browser** : Primarily Chrome and when it slows down, i switch to Opera

### Chrome Extensions (First 3 are must have for me)
* The Great Suspender
* Momentum 
* OneTab
* Fair Adblocker
* JSONView

### Headsets 
* Microsoft Lumia Headset
* Boult Red Audio Neckband Q9

### Music
