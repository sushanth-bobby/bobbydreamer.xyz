**The Ostrich Effect:** ignoring negative information or feedback, similar to an ostrich burying its head in the sand; counter this by regularly reviewing your situation even if it's uncomfortable.

**Inability to close doors:** difficulty making decisions due to fear of missing out on other opportunities; focusing on one thing is more effective, but people often work on multiple ideas at once, leading to no or average results.

**The Contrast Effect:** judgment of one thing is affected by recent exposure to something else; for example, showing a terrible house before a nice one makes the second house seem better.

**Chauffeur Knowledge:** someone seems knowledgeable and confident but lacks genuine expertise; identify such individuals by asking deeper questions, as they can't provide detailed insights.

**The Ikea Effect:** overvaluing something because you put effort into creating it; avoid overvaluing by getting external feedback to assess the real value of your efforts and make objective decisions.

**The Curse of Specificity:** extremely detailed information seems more persuasive even if it's irrelevant; be cautious of this when evaluating information.

**The Spotlight Effect:** thinking people notice your appearance, mistakes, or behavior more than they actually do; remind yourself that others are usually too focused on themselves to notice minor things about you.

**The Halo Effect:** impression of someone in one area influences your opinion of them in other areas; avoid this by judging each situation or decision on its own facts.

**Reciprocity:** feeling obliged to give back when someone gives you something; recognize when you're reacting out of obligation rather than genuine desire.

**The Self-Serving Bias:** crediting yourself for successes but blaming external factors for failures; practice taking responsibility for your actions, both good and bad.

**The Dito Effect:** acquiring a new possession leads to a spiral of additional purchases; be mindful of how one purchase can influence your overall spending.

**The Anchoring Effect:** first impression or an initial number shapes subsequent thinking; always view offers and decisions independently, not just in comparison to the first option you've seen.

**Negativity Bias:** paying more attention to negative events than positive ones; consciously shift your perspective to positive events and be grateful.

**The Sunk Cost Fallacy:** continuing to do something because you've already invested a lot in it; base your investment or business decisions on potential future returns rather than past costs.

**The Paradox of Choice:** having too many options makes it harder to make a decision; limit your own options and the options you give to others.

**The Framing Effect:** decisions are influenced by how information is presented; consider facts from multiple perspectives before making a decision.

**The End of History Illusion:** believing who you are now is who you'll be forever; embrace the idea of change and recognize that your preferences and beliefs will change.

**The Pygmalion Effect:** higher expectations lead to an increase in performance; aim to achieve your goals in a shorter time frame to significantly increase your performance.

**Consistency Principle:** being consistent with what you've previously said or done enhances commitment to your goals; find someone to hold you accountable.

**The Planning Fallacy:** underestimating how long it will take to do something; always add extra time to help plan your day better and reduce stress.

**Confirmation Bias:** noticing things that support what you already believe; actively look for information that challenges your views.

**The Bandwagon Effect:** copying what others do because everyone else has it; ask yourself why you're making a decision and if it's really what you want.

**The Dunning-Kruger Effect:** people with less skill or knowledge overestimate their ability; be cautious when making important decisions and consult with experts.

**Loss Aversion:** the fear of losing something motivates you more than the potential gain; focus on what you could gain, not just what you could lose.

**The Decoy Effect:** preference between two options changes when a third, less attractive option is introduced; evaluate each option alone.

**The Availability Heuristic:** judging the likelihood of events based on how easily you can remember them; look for actual facts and statistics before making a decision.

**The Gambler's Fallacy:** thinking past events affect future ones, especially in random situations; remember that each event is independent.

**The Hindsight Bias:** believing you predicted an event after it has occurred; focus on the actual likelihood of events instead of assuming you knew the outcome.

**The Reactant Bias:** wanting to do the opposite of what you're told because you feel your freedom is being threatened; focus on why the action is beneficial for you.
