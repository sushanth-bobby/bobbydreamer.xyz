One thing. Idea of one thing is that you have clear priority.  If you align your priorities over time. You get huge momentum and leverage in your actions. 2inch domino can knock down Eiffel tower.

 Compound interest is the eighth wonder if the world. Good habits, diet, financial habits compound. Live on less than I earn and invest the rest. Positive habits and negative habits define us and being aware of them and purposeful in building them is one of the powerful thing you can do. If you start working for your habits, whats beautiful is quickly they will start working for you. Success is sequential not simultaneous. Look at your to-do list on weekly basis and prioritze them.  In the todo list always prioritise by numbering them. Work on the one.  

**What is your WHY**    

* Why is that goal important to you
* What will accomplishimg that goal do for your life ? 
* What will happen if you do not accomplish this goal ?
