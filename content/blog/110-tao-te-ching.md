#### Verse 2 
When people see some things as beautiful,     
other things become ugly.     
When people see some things as good,     
other things become bad.     

Being and non-being create each other.     
Difficult and easy support each other.     
Long and short define each other.     
High and low depend on each other.     
Before and after follow each other.     

Therefore the Master acts without doing anything     
and teaches without saying anything.     
Things arise and she lets them come;     
things disappear and she lets them go.     
She has but doesn't possess,     
acts but doesn't expect.     
When her work is done, she forgets it.     
That is why it lasts forever.     

#### Verse 8
The supreme good is like water,     
which nourishes all things without trying to.     
It is content with the low places that people disdain.     
Thus it is like the Tao.     
     
In dwelling, live close to the ground.     
In thinking, keep to the simple.     
In conflict, be fair and generous.     
In governing, don't try to control.     
In work, do what you enjoy.     
In family life, be completely present.     
     
When you are content to be simply yourself     
and don't compare or compete,     
everybody will respect you     

#### Verse 9 
Fill your bowl to the brim     
and it will spill.     
Keep sharpening your knife     
and it will blunt.     
Chase after money and security     
and your heart will never unclench.     
Care about people's approval     
and you will be their prisoner.     
     
Do your work, then step back.     
The only path to serenity.     

#### Verse 15
The ancient Masters were profound and subtle.     
Their wisdom was unfathomable.     
There is no way to describe it;     
all we can describe is their appearance.     
     
They were careful     
as someone crossing an iced-over stream.     
Alert as a warrior in enemy territory.     
Courteous as a guest.     
Fluid as melting ice.     
Shapable as a block of wood.     
Receptive as a valley.     
Clear as a glass of water.     
     
Do you have the patience to wait     
till your mud settles and the water is clear?     
Can you remain unmoving     
till the right action arises by itself?     
     
The Master doesn't seek fulfillment.     
Not seeking, not expecting,     
she is present, and can welcome all things.     

#### Verse 18 
When the great Tao is forgotten,     
goodness and piety appear.     
When the body's intelligence declines,     
cleverness and knowledge step forth.     
When there is no peace in the family,     
filial piety begins.     
When the country falls into chaos,     
patriotism is born.     

#### Verse 27
A good traveler has no fixed plans     
and is not intent upon arriving.     
A good artist lets his intuition     
lead him wherever it wants.     
A good scientist has freed himself of concepts     
and keeps his mind open to what is.     
     
Thus the Master is available to all people     
and doesn't reject anyone.     
He is ready to use all situations     
and doesn't waste anything.     
This is called embodying the light.     
     
What is a good man but a bad man's teacher?     
What is a bad man but a good man's job?     
If you don't understand this, you will get lost,     
however intelligent you are.     
It is the great secret.     

#### Verse 29
Do you want to improve the world?     
I don't think it can be done.     
     
The world is sacred.     
It can't be improved.     
If you tamper with it, you'll ruin it.     
If you treat it like an object, you'll lose it.     
     
There is a time for being ahead,     
a time for being behind;     
a time for being in motion,     
a time for being at rest;     
a time for being vigorous,     
a time for being exhausted;     
a time for being safe,     
a time for being in danger.     
     
The Master sees things as they are,     
without trying to control them.     
She lets them go their own way,     
and resides at the center of the circle.     

#### Verse 30
Whoever relies on the Tao in governing men     
doesn't try to force issues     
or defeat enemies by force of arms.     
For every force there is a counterforce.     
Violence, even well intentioned,     
always rebounds upon oneself.     
     
The Master does his job     
and then stops.     
He understands that the universe     
is forever out of control,     
and that trying to dominate events     
goes against the current of the Tao.     
Because he believes in himself,     
he doesn't try to convince others.     
Because he is content with himself,     
he doesn't need others' approval.     
Because he accepts himself,     
the whole world accepts him.     

#### Verse 33
Knowing others is intelligence;     
knowing yourself is true wisdom.     
Mastering others is strength;     
mastering yourself is true power.     
     
If you realize that you have enough,     
you are truly rich.     
If you stay in the center     
and embrace death with your whole heart,     
you will endure forever.     

#### Verse 36
If you want to shrink something,     
you must first allow it to expand.     
If you want to get rid of something,     
you must first allow it to flourish.     
If you want to take something,     
you must first allow it to be given.     
This is called the subtle perception     
of the way things are.     
     
The soft overcomes the hard.     
The slow overcomes the fast.     
Let your workings remain a mystery.     
Just show people the results.     

#### Verse 38
The Master doesn't try to be powerful;     
thus he is truly powerful.     
The ordinary man keeps reaching for power;     
thus he never has enough.     
     
The Master does nothing,     
yet he leaves nothing undone.     
The ordinary man is always doing things,     
yet many more are left to be done.     
     
The kind man does something,     
yet something remains undone.     
The just man does something,     
and leaves many things to be done.     
The moral man does something,     
and when no one responds     
he rolls up his sleeves and uses force.     
     
When the Tao is lost, there is goodness.     
When goodness is lost, there is morality.     
When morality is lost, there is ritual.     
Ritual is the husk of true faith,     
the beginning of chaos.     

Therefore the Master concerns himself     
with the depths and not the surface,     
with the fruit and not the flower.     
He has no will of his own.     
He dwells in reality,     
and lets all illusions go.     

#### Verse 44
Fame or integrity: which is more important?     
Money or happiness: which is more valuable?     
Success of failure: which is more destructive?     
     
If you look to others for fulfillment,     
you will never truly be fulfilled.     
If your happiness depends on money,     
you will never be happy with yourself.     
     
Be content with what you have;     
rejoice in the way things are.     
When you realize there is nothing lacking,     
the whole world belongs to you.     

#### Verse 48
In pursuit of knowledge,     
every day something is added.     
In the practice of the Tao,     
every day something is dropped.     
Less and less do you need to force things,     
until finally you arrive at non-action.     
When nothing is done,     
nothing is left undone.     
     
True mastery can be gained     
by letting things go their own way.     
It can't be gained by interfering.     

#### Verse 56
Those who know don't talk.     
Those who talk don't know.     
     
Close your mouth,     
block off your senses,     
blunt your sharpness,     
untie your knots,     
soften your glare,     
settle your dust.     
This is the primal identity.     
     
Be like the Tao.     
It can't be approached or withdrawn from,     
benefited or harmed,     
honored or brought into disgrace.     
It gives itself up continually.     
That is why it endures.     

#### Verse 61
When a country obtains great power,     
it becomes like the sea:     
all streams run downward into it.     
The more powerful it grows,     
the greater the need for humility.     
Humility means trusting the Tao,     
thus never needing to be defensive.     
     
A great nation is like a great man:     
When he makes a mistake, he realizes it.     
Having realized it, he admits it.     
Having admitted it, he corrects it.     
He considers those who point out his faults     
as his most benevolent teachers.     
He thinks of his enemy     
as the shadow that he himself casts.     

If a nation is centered in the Tao,     
if it nourishes its own people     
and doesn't meddle in the affairs of others,     
it will be a light to all nations in the world.     

#### Verse 64
What is rooted is easy to nourish.     
What is recent is easy to correct.     
What is brittle is easy to break.     
What is small is easy to scatter.     

Prevent trouble before it arises.     
Put things in order before they exist.     
The giant pine tree     
grows from a tiny sprout.     
The journey of a thousand miles     
starts from beneath your feet.     

Rushing into action, you fail.     
Trying to grasp things, you lose them.     
Forcing a project to completion,     
you ruin what was almost ripe.     
     
Therefore the Master takes action     
by letting things take their course.     
He remains as calm     
at the end as at the beginning.     
He has nothing,     
thus has nothing to lose.     
What he desires is non-desire;     
what he learns is to unlearn.     
He simply reminds people     
of who they have always been.     
He cares about nothing but the Tao.     
Thus he can care for all things.     

#### Verse 65
The ancient Masters     
didn't try to educate the people,     
but kindly taught them to not-know.     
     
When they think that they know the answers,     
people are difficult to guide.     
When they know that they don't know,     
people can find their own way.     
     
If you want to learn how to govern,     
avoid being clever or rich.     
The simplest pattern is the clearest.     
Content with an ordinary life,     
you can show all people the way     
back to their own true nature.     

#### Verse 67
Some say that my teaching is nonsense.     
Others call it lofty but impractical.     
But to those who have looked inside themselves,     
this nonsense makes perfect sense.     
And to those who put it into practice,     
this loftiness has roots that go deep.     
     
I have just three things to teach:     
simplicity, patience, compassion.     
These three are your greatest treasures.     
Simple in actions and in thoughts,     
you return to the source of being.     
Patient with both friends and enemies,     
you accord with the way things are.     
Compassionate toward yourself,     
you reconcile all beings in the world.     

#### Verse 68
The best athlete     
wants his opponent at his best.     
The best general     
enters the mind of his enemy.     
The best businessman     
serves the communal good.     
The best leader     
follows the will of the people.     
     
All of the embody     
the virtue of non-competition.     
Not that they don't love to compete,     
but they do it in the spirit of play.     
In this they are like children     
and in harmony with the Tao.     

#### Verse 69
The generals have a saying:     
"Rather than make the first move     
it is better to wait and see.     
Rather than advance an inch     
it is better to retreat a yard."     
     
This is called     
going forward without advancing,     
pushing back without using weapons.     
     
There is no greater misfortune     
than underestimating your enemy.     
Underestimating your enemy     
means thinking that he is evil.     
Thus you destroy your three treasures     
and become an enemy yourself.     
     
When two great forces oppose each other,     
the victory will go to the one that knows how to yield.
