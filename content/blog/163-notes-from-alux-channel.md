#### Increasing Financial IQ
* Billionaries are made during economic turmoil. Financially educated people see this as opportunities as they know economy has its own life cycle.

* Master the rule of 72. 6% when divided by 72 will tell how long it will take to double.
```
72 / 6 = 12
```

* 72 hour rule. Wait to buy anything for 72 hours. In the mean time, look for options and study/research of that thing.
	* Minimum is to have a 48-hour rule. Anything i see and think, "i want that," i wait at least 2 days. If im still thinking about it and want it then i wait another 24 hrs. If i STILL want it, then i get it. Around 85% of the shit i think i want doesn't past this test.

* Study and Analyze financial success and failures of others and learn from it

* Zero Based Budgeting – Budget all the money.
