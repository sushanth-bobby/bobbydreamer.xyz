Below are some notes taken while listening to audio book "Lead the field" by Earl Nightingale. 

Book has many chapters but my takeaway is divided into two *Attitude* and *Goal*. Here are the notes, 

### # 1. Attitude
  + Our attitude tells what we expect from the world. How others respond is their attitude. 
    - Dont expect other to come and talk to you. You go and talk and tell you are interested in any activity. 
    - If you dont go, it means you are not interested. 
    - In every action and response, show attitude. 
    - People are important, interact with them. 

  + Your mind is your richest resource
    - go deep with what you already know before going on to something else.
  + Serve the customer; serve the customer better than anyone else is serving the customer.

Few points to keep in mind,    

* First, it's our attitude at the beginning of a difficult task which, more than anything else, will bring
about its successful outcome.

* Secondly, our attitudes toward others determine their attitudes toward us. We're all interdependent. The success we achieve in life will depend largely on how well we relate to others.

* Thirdly, before you can achieve the kind of life you want, you must think, act, talk, and conduct yourself in all of your affairs as would the person you wish to become. Keep a mental picture of that person before you as often as you can during the day.

* Fourthly, remember that the higher you go in any organization of value, the better the attitudes you'll find. And that great attitudes are not the result of success; success is the result of great attitudes. Finally, the deepest craving of the human being is for recognition and self-esteem – to be needed, to feel important, to be recognized and appreciated. That includes our loved ones and everyone else with whom we come in contact during our days.

**Some suggestions,**    

* Since your mind can hold only one thought at a time, make each thought you hold constructive
and positive. Look for the best in people and ideas. Be constantly alert for new ideas you can put
to use in your life.

* Don't waste time talking about your problems with people who can't solve them, or about your health unless it's good or you're talking to your doctor. It won't help you. It can't help others.

* Radiate the attitude of well-being and confidence, the attitude of the person who knows where he or she is going. You'll find all sorts of good things happening to you.

* Lastly, treat everyone with whom you come in contact as the most important person on earth. Start this habit, practice it consistently, and you'll do it – and benefit from it – for the rest of your life.


### # 2. Goal 

  + Make sure you constantly reevaluate your goals and move forward
  + Write down your goals
  + Focus your thinking toward your goals. It will help you reach them.
  + Work on one goal at a time.
  + We become what we think about
  + You are sum total of all your thoughts. Think about the right things and in time your sum total will encompass those thoughts.
  + Just thinking about your goal moves your toward it.
  + Thirdly, before you can achieve the kind of life you want, you must think, act, talk, and conduct yourself as would the person you wish to become.

* * *

**Task : Take 1 hour per day and use it to think**     

  + Write your primary goal
  + write down ways in which you can improve upon your work each day
  + Most ideas will suck
  + This isn't easy

* * *

  + Start your day with this thought : How can i increase my service today ?
  + There are better ways to do what I'm presently doing; what are they?
  + How will my work be performed 20 years from now? Everything in the world is in a state of evolution; how can I do now what will eventually be done anyway?
  + What a mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve.
  + We become what we think about 
  + Have a goal, work towards it, with attitude.
  + Do not waste time, worrying about things that will never happen. 92% of problem will never happen
  + Happiness/Rewards comes from in service to others.(We need each other, we cannot live without one another). 

  + Assess whether you are working not only hard but intelligently.

  + Integrity means to try, as best we can, to know ourselves, to examine ourselves as Socrates
advised, and to make a true assessment of ourselves – an inventory of our abilities, our talents,
our goals
  + Being truthful to ourselves mean, taking the responsibility of making the best use of what we have, what do we have ? We have our Under utilized minds, Our abilities, Our talents, Time. These are our possessions. This is really an immense amount of wealth that belongs to each of us. And it's the investment of our wealth that will determine our rate of return.  

  + And if you have days in which you find yourself depressed or confused, remember this comment by Dean Briggs
    > “Do your work. Not just your work and no more, but a little more for the lavishing's sake – that little more which is worth all the rest. And if you suffer, as you must, and if you doubt, as you must, do your work. Put your heart into it, and the sky will clear. Then, out of your very doubt and suffering, will be born the supreme joy of life.”

  + There is nothing in the world can stop a plan backed by persistence and determination. 


  + Treat yourself like a business
    - research, production, and sales. They are the head, hands, and legs of a company.
    - A company growing at the rate of 10 percent a year will double in size in about eight years. What attention are you giving to the production of your personal corporation? Can you grow and improve as a person at least 10 percent a year?
    - An ongoing education is vital, if we are to stay vital.
    - To research – to the study of your work, your career? Can this be improved?
    - What about production? How can you vastly improve the way in which you conduct your work?
    - And how can your sales be improved? Sales entails more than selling a product or service; it includes the way in which we sell ourselves to everyone with whom we come in contact. It includes the way we get along with our associates, our spouse, our kids, our neighbors.

  + The amount of money we receive will always be in direct ratio to the demand for what we do, to our ability to do it, and to the difficulty of replacing us.
  + Improve vocabulary, learn words and how to use them. Say them loudly and precisely. 
  + Start
    - Language and vocabulary building
    - General area of interest 
  + Work as though you would live forever; but live as though you would die tomorrow.

  + The best way for you to develop the security that lasts a lifetime is to become outstanding at one particular line of work.
  + When he was asked the formula for success, the great steel magnate, Andrew Carnegie, answered, *Put all your eggs in one basket, and then watch the basket.*
  + Do your best each day.

Work on item number one until it is successfully completed. Then move on to number two, and so on. When you've finished with all six, repeat the process.
2. Make certain that the tasks you spend your time on are important ones — tasks that will move you ahead, steadily, toward your goal.
  * List below any tasks that you might be able to delegate to others or even eliminate from your agenda — tasks that, over time, have become unnecessary or obsolete
3. How well do you deal with interruptions and distractions? If you are often sidetracked during your day – by nonurgent telephone calls, drop-in visitors, etc. — plan a strategy for handling those diversions.
