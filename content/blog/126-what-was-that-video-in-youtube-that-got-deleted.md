There is one service from youtube i really hate is, when a video is deleted by Youtube or Uploader, you never know what video it was to add back. If they looked into this, it would be a great help. 

Now on the other ways of finding out what was deleted. **THE WAYBACK MACHINE** 

Below are the steps i follow to find out what was deleted. 

1. Go to youtube and copy the url of the deleted video. You just the actual link removed the additional parameters like watchlist and other parameters. 

```sh
Original link address, might look like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_IynEEZvxw&list=PLneJQRqrf8REPvYJCx30B864L1LYt-JmI&index=2&t=56s

Actually what you need is, just this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_IynEEZvxw
```

2. Go to [archive.org](https://archive.org/) and paste the URL

3. Be Patient. It takes time. 

4. After 5 minute of searching, you may get details like below. Click on a circle and click a sublink
