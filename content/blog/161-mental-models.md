### What are Mental Models?
* A mental model is a representation of how the world works, helping us understand complex things in simple way.
* Provide a toolbox for problem-solving and decision-making
* Help to identify blind spots and limitations

* * *
#### Map is Not the Territory
* The representation of reality is not reality itself
* Be aware of the limitations and imperfections of models and maps

* * *
#### Circle of Competence
* Identify areas of expertise and knowledge
* Recognize when decisions fall outside of your circle of competence
* Consult experts when necessary

* * *
#### Second-Order Thinking
* Consider the consequences of consequences
* Think holistically and anticipate long-term effects

Chesterton’s Fence: A Lesson in Second Order Thinking

A core component of making great decisions is understanding the rationale behind previous decisions. If we don’t understand how we got “here,” we run the risk of making things much worse.

Second-order thinking is the practice of not just considering the consequences of our decisions but also the consequences of those consequences. Everyone can manage first-order thinking, which is just considering the immediate anticipated result of an action. It’s simple and quick, usually requiring little effort. By comparison, second-order thinking is more complex and time-consuming. The fact that it is difficult and unusual is what makes the ability to do it such a powerful advantage.

Chesterton’s Fence, described by G. K. Chesterton himself as follows:There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away.” To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: “If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.”

Even so, we can’t let ourselves be too overconfident about the redundancy of things we see as pointless. Or, to paraphrase Rory Sutherland, the peacock’s tail is not about efficiency. In fact, its whole value lies in its inefficiency. It signals a bird is healthy enough to waste energy growing it and has the strength to carry it around. Peahens use the tails of peacocks as guidance for choosing which mates are likely to have the best genes to pass on to their offspring. If an outside observer were to somehow swoop in and give peacocks regular, functional tails, it would be more energy efficient and practical, but it would deprive them of the ability to advertise their genetic potential.

#### Probabilistic Thinking
* Estimate the likelihood of outcomes using math and logic
* Assign probabilities to events to make more accurate decisions

* * *
#### Inversion
* Identify obstacles to success and remove them
* Think about what failure looks like and avoid it

* * *
#### Occam's Razor
* Prefer simpler explanations over complex ones
* Base decisions on the explanation with the fewest moving parts

* * *
#### Hanlon's Razor
* Do not attribute to maliciousness what can be explained by incompetence
* Assume ignorance or circumstance rather than malice

* * *
#### Reciprocity
* Treat others with kindness and expect kindness in return
* Recognize that actions have consequences and reactions

* * *
#### Activation Energy
* Identify the energy required to start a task or project
* Use catalysts to lower the activation energy and make progress easier

##### Said by [Anthony Vicino](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5SBcAuqCSg) , Strategic Mental Models

**Control the center**,  the high ground.  Identify where your focus should be ? Higher priority task which gives maximum result.  In chess is the center of the board(for bishop,  Knight) they can move in more places than corner. 

**True value of the piece**.  Value of person is,  what they are capable of,  where you put them.  Ask the right questions to right people.  In chess a piece can control more than one opponents piece. 

**Controlling the positions**.  In fighting,  beginners are looking for one shot that would end the match.  Black belts look for dominate positions like sitting on opponent and then choke them effortlessly. To control the position,  you got to know the environment, have the right training,  mind and skill and then dominate. 

**Initiative**.  Which player is dictating.  Who is acting,  Who is reacting.  Initiative leads to Momentum. It's cure to lots of things laziness,  overthinking, It's gets you to move.

**Making the Hardest move**. Taking a step back. The move which will affect you right away.  But the move will help you tremendously later. Like freeing stress,  giving you more time.

Rather than fixating on the end goal, focus on the journey, consistently align actions that contribute to journey which takes you to the goal,  learning and improving from the current approach and steps towards the goal.
